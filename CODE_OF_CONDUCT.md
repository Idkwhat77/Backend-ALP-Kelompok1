# Code of Conduct - Kelompok 1

## About This Project

This is our **Semester 2 Final Project** that demonstrates our understanding of:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** 
- **Web Programming**
- **Database Management**

We're still learning, and this project is part of our academic journey! üìö

## Our Team Values

### ü§ù Collaboration
- **Help each other learn** - We all have different strengths
- **Share knowledge** - If you figure something out, teach the others
- **Ask questions** - No question is too basic when we're learning
- **Be patient** - We're all at different learning levels

### üíª Development Standards
- **Write clean code** - Make it readable for your teammates
- **Comment your code** - Explain what you're doing, especially complex parts
- **Test your changes** - Make sure it works before pushing
- **Use meaningful variable names** - No more `int a, b, c;`
- **Follow our project structure** - Keep files organized

### üìö Learning Focus
- **Academic integrity** - Do your own work, but collaborate openly
- **Document what you learn** - Help future students (and future you!)
- **Try new things** - This is the time to experiment and learn
- **Learn from mistakes** - Bugs are learning opportunities

## Team Communication

### ‚úÖ Good Practices
- Use clear commit messages: `"Add user login validation"` not `"fix stuff"`
- Communicate when you're working on something
- Share your screen when explaining code
- Celebrate small wins together!
- Ask for help when stuck

### ‚ùå What to Avoid
- Don't work in isolation for too long
- Don't be afraid to break things (that's what version control is for!)
- Don't copy-paste code without understanding it
- Don't leave teammates hanging without communication

## Project Guidelines

### Database Work
- Always backup before major changes
- Document your schema changes
- Test queries before implementing
- Share database updates with the team

### Backend Development (Spring Boot)
- Follow REST API conventions we learned
- Handle errors gracefully
- Keep controllers simple
- Use proper HTTP status codes

### General Development
- One feature per branch when possible
- Write simple tests for main functionality
- Keep the README updated
- Comment complex logic

## When Things Go Wrong

### Technical Issues
1. **Try to debug together** - pair programming helps learning
2. **Check documentation** - Spring Boot, MySQL docs are your friends
3. **Ask teammates** - someone might have solved it already
4. **Google the error** - but understand the solution
5. **Ask instructor** - when you're really stuck

### Team Issues
- **Talk it out** - Most issues come from miscommunication
- **Be respectful** - We're all trying our best
- **Focus on the code, not the person** - "This function could be improved" not "You're wrong"
- **Take breaks** - Debugging at 2 AM makes everyone grumpy

## Our Learning Goals

By the end of this project, we should understand:
- ‚úÖ How to build a REST API with Spring Boot
- ‚úÖ How to design and implement a database
- ‚úÖ How to structure an OOP application
- ‚úÖ How to work as a team on a coding project
- ‚úÖ How to debug and solve problems together

## Team Members & Roles

- üìñ Learn new concepts
- üî® Practice what we've studied
- ü§ù Work as a team
- üéØ Complete our semester requirements
- üåü Have some fun coding!

**Mistakes are part of learning. Let's make them together and learn from them! üöÄ**
